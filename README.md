## Getting Started

If you are new to Kobweb framework, please visit Kobweb's [official website](https://kobweb.varabyte.com/docs) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb/) to learn more about it. 
From the repository, you can learn about setting up the development environment, building the project, and exporting functional website. Currently, official website doesn't contain much information so, most of the things are documented on repository's [readme](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb/#:~:text=Apache%2D2.0%20license-,K%F0%9F%95%B8%EF%B8%8Fbweb,-Kobweb%20is%20an) file. Once you are done with Kobweb setup, please follow the steps given below to set up this project locally.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/Sushant-Hande/portfolio-kobweb.git
```

**2. Run the development server by typing the following command in a terminal under the `site` folder:**

```bash
  $ cd site
  $ kobweb run
```

**3. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.**

You can use any editor you want for the project but, it is recommended to use **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** which can be downloaded
using the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/). Press `Q` in the terminal to gracefully stop the server.
